# RestaurantApp

I love being organized and having my ideas sorted out for me. For months, I have a kept a note on my phone of all the restaurants in Saint Louis that I would like to try. When I would try them, I would add them to a new list marked either “good” or “bad.” What better way to sort these lists than a new app that will do it for me?

## Description
My app will allow a user to make a “to-do” list of restaurants they want to try. Once the user has been to the restaurant, they can check the it off their list and rate it. In essence, users will be creating a directory of restaurants they want to try, restaurants they have tried and liked, and restaurants they have tried and didn't like. Users will be able sort their to-do lists by user-created categories, priority, or alphabetical order. Additionally, if a user tries to add a new restaurant to their list which they have already tried, the application will let them know and give them option to continue or not. When adding or rating a restaurant, the user can add any personal notes they would like to make. If a user has already tried a restaurant that was not on their to-do list originally but would still like to add it to their “directory,” they have the option to do that as well. The point of this app is NOT to provide a restaurant-themed "social media" outlet for users to interact, comment, etc (that is what Yelp is for!), rather it is to keep a simple and personal running list of restaurants you want to try, restaurants you would go back to, and restaurants you would not.
